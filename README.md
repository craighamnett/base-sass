# Usage

Clone the base-sass project into your local project.

    git clone git://github.com/mitchellbryson/base-sass.git sass/base

Create a new sass file in your sass folder to import the base sass.

    @import base/styles
  
Run the sass watcher to compile the css every time you save a sass file.

    sass --watch sass:css

The markup supplied in templates gives you an idea for classes to use, mostly for forms.
The templates folder can be removed.
